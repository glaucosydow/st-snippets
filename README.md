#st-snippets

List of useful snippets I made for working with front-end development on Sublime Text.

## Installation

	git clone git@github.com:rafaelrinaldi/st-snippets.git ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User

## Update
The snippets are updated quite often. To make sure you're running the latest version of the snippets, simply run:

	git pull ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User

## CSS3 snippets
There are snippets for all the new properties of CSS3, already implementing vendor prefixes. [css3please.com](http://css3please.com) was used as a reference.
