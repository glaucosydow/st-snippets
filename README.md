#st-snippets

List of snippets I have made for working with Sublime Text on my everyday work.

## Installation

	git clone git@github.com:rafaelrinaldi/st-snippets.git && mv -f st-snippets ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/st-snippets

## Update
The snippets are updated quite often. To make sure you're running the latest version of the snippets, simply run:

	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/st-snippets && git pull
	
## Removing
To remove the snippets from your Sublime Text folder, run:

	rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/st-snippets

	
> If you're running Sublime Text 3, make sure you change the destination path of the commands above.
