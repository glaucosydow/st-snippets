#st-snippets

List of useful snippets I made for working with front-end development on Sublime Text.

## Installation

	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/ && git clone git@github.com:rafaelrinaldi/st-snippets.git

## Update
The snippets are updated quite often. To make sure you're running the latest version of the snippets, simply run:

	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/st-snippets && git pull

## CSS3 snippets
There are snippets for all the new properties of CSS3, already implementing vendor prefixes. [css3please.com](http://css3please.com) was used as a reference.
